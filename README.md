ClefNotes is a notes and organization app designed for private music teachers to help manage their students' information and track their weekly lesson times. It is built using the cross-platform React Native library (iPhone- and Android-friendly) and uses Google Firebase for user authentication and user data storage.

### Demo Installation

ClefNotes will soon be added to the App Store and Google Play but in the meantime, a live demo of it can be found [here](https://snack.expo.io/@sheriffhoodie/clefnotes)! Simply download the free Expo Client app on your mobile device and scan the QR code that appears in the link. You can then demo the app on your own device and in the browser.

## Features

### Code Sample

## Future Directions

In future updates, I'd like to implement the following:

- add an option to open student addresses in Maps
- sync student lesson days and times with phone Calendar app
- add reset password by email option to login form
- add Google and/or Facebook authentication options
- add push notifications and alerts for upcoming lessons
